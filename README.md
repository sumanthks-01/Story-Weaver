- Simple, clean interface

## Quick Start

1. **Setup Firebase** (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md for detailed guide):
   - Create Firebase project
   - Enable Firestore
   - Update config in `frontend/src/firebase.js`

   npm run install-all
   ```

   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## GitHub Pages Setup

   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name"
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**

## How It Works

1. **Start a Story**: Create a new story with an opening sentence
2. **Continue Stories**: Select an active story, see only the latest sentence, and add your own
